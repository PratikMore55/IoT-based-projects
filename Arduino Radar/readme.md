# Arduino Radar 

## About

This Arduino Radar project involves the use of a servo motor and an ultrasonic sensor. The servo motor sweeps the sensor across a specified range, measuring distances at different angles. The collected data is sent to a computer where it is visualized in real-time using a Processing sketch. This project offers a simple and effective way to create a radar system using readily available Arduino components, providing a hands-on experience in sensor integration and data visualization.
