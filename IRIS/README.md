# IRIS

IRIS is a Smart device for a blind indivisuals which serves various functionalities powered by Raspberry Pi, featuring Pi Camera and Neo6M module for enhanced functionality and navigation.

## ABSTRACT

Each functionality of IRIS and its real-world use :

---

‚Ä¢ GPS Tracker-

---

This feature is beneficial for the family members of the blind person. If they are unable to contact the blind person they can just get his/her location in a single click using telegram. For this, I've used a Neo 6m GPS Module which sends the longitude and latitude coordinates of a blind person via telegram.

---

‚Ä¢ OCR with GTTS-

---

OCR (optical character recognition) is used to read text from an image and convert it into speech with the help of GTTS (google text to speech) and give output in audio format.

---

‚Ä¢ Click n send-

---

The moto behind this function is if the blind person wants to send any kind of image to his/her family member, with a single click of a button they can do that. Imagine a scenario where a blind person needs to send a picture of a QR code for payment, with just one click it can be sent via a telegram bot.

---

‚Ä¢ Currency Recognition-

---

This function tells if the currency given to the blind person is fake or real and also how much amount it is.
